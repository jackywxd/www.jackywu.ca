Today I passed the exam for AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, and offically became certified!

And I got this interesting Digital Badges which can be accessed with this link:

I started using AWS EC2 back to 2010. But not until 2016 when I started work with this new startup company and my company pretty much run everything in AWS.

Since I uses AWS for my daily works, it doesn't take long for me to prepare for this exam, actually only two weeks. Comparing with my previouse certification, CISSP, it is much shorter. It took me two months to prepare CISSP and I did not pass the first time.

Talking about the test, total there are 55 questions, Multiple choice and multiple answer questions. 80 minutes to complete the exam.

Anyway, mission accomplished! I guess my next goal will be the AWS Certified Developer – Associate.
