An SSL VPN is a type of virtual private network that uses the Secure Sockets Layer protocol -- or, more often, its successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol -- in standard web browsers to provide secure, remote-access VPN capability. SSL VPN enables devices with an internet connection to establish a secure remote-access VPN connection with a web browser. An SSL VPN connection uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to protect data transmitted between the endpoint device client software and the SSL VPN server through which the client connects securely to the internet.

Because this SSL/TLS function exists ubiquitously in modern web browsers. Unlike traditional IP Security (IPSec) remote-access VPN technology, which requires installation of IPSec client software on a client machine before a connection can be established, users typically do not need to install client software in order to use SSL VPN. As a result, SSL VPN is also known as “client-less VPN” or “Web VPN.”

These 3 protocols are the best VPN protocols to works in China, the United Arab Emirates (especially Dubai) and Saudi Arabia.

OpenVPN
OpenVPN is an SSL VPN open-source software application that uses VPN techniques to create a secure connection between sites. The OpenVPN security protocol uses SSL for the key exchange (IKE). The advantages of an OpenVPN include portability, ease of configuration, compatibility with NAT, and dynamic addresses.

SSTP
SSTP, or Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol, s a proprietary Microsoft protocol, and is best supported on Windows, and is another form of SSL VPN that provides a means of transporting L2TP or PPP traffic through an SSL channel. SSTP provides the highest level of data security and safety. SSTP also offers high accessibility as it mimics a normal HTTP connection, which typically cannot be banned. This makes SSTP the best VPN option for China.

SoftEther
SoftEther is another SSL VPN and a good alternative to OpenVPN. SoftEther is a free, cross platform, open source VPN solution. It employs strategies such as parallel transmission that can reduce latency and increase throughput. SoftEther is based on HTTPS, which means it is permitted by almost every firewall. This is the main advantage of SoftEther over other VPN options.

Cisco AnyConnect

The industry-leading AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client is a modular endpoint software product. It not only provides VPN access through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and IPsec IKEv2 but also offers enhanced security through various built-in modules. These modules provide services such as compliance through the VPN with ASA or through wired, wireless, and VPN with Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), web security along side Cisco Cloud Web Security, network visibility into endpoint flows within Stealth-watch, or off-network roaming protection with Cisco Umbrella. AnyConnect clients are available across a broad set of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Windows Phone/Mobile, BlackBerry, and ChromeOS.

OpenConnect

OpenConnect is an open-source software application for connecting to virtual private networks (VPN), which implement secure point-to-point connections.

It was originally written as an open-source replacement for Cisco's proprietary AnyConnect SSL VPN client, which is supported by
several Cisco routers. As of 2013, the OpenConnect project also offers an AnyConnect-compatible server, ocserv, and thus offers a full client-server VPN solution.
