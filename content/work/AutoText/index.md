AutoText is modern design scheduled messages mobile App. It came out from a pet project which I used to learn Mobile development and Google Firebase platform. 

### Key features of AutoText

- SEND GROUP MESSAGES AUTOMATICALLY. You can schedule and send messages to unlimited recipients automatically.

- SEND APPOINTMENT REMINDERS, INCREASE CUSTOMER RETENTION and much more. AutoText can help you to be a better business by sending prewritten messages to your clients, staff or network automatically. You can schedule and (auto)send appointment reminders, meeting reminders or other messages to individuals as well as groups. Reduce no-shows and keep your network or staff informed in an easy and personal way.
